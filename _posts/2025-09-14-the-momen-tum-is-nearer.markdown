I'd been thinking about starting a blog for years. Not because I had anything particularly profound to say, but because I kept having these thoughts that felt like they needed somewhere to live. Ideas that would wake me up at 3 AM, fragments of conversations that stuck with me, moments of clarity that came and went like summer storms.

But I never started. There was always a reason to wait. The perfect moment, the right setup, more experience to draw from. I'd tell myself I needed to be more established, have more interesting stories, become someone worth listening to first.

Then I realized something stupidly obvious: everyone starts somewhere. Every voice that matters now was once just someone with something to say and the courage to say it.

So here I am, writing my first post on a blog that might never get read by anyone but me. And that's okay. Because the act of putting thoughts into words, of making the internal external, that's where the real value lives.

The momentum is building. Not because of some grand plan or external validation, but because I finally stopped waiting for permission to begin.

Adam is my name.
