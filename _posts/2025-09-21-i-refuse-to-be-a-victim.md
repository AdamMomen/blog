title: I Refuse To Be A Victim

The visa officer skimmed my documents and slid them back across the glass. **Denied.**

I’d prepared for months. I’d even rented a home in Indonesia **a full year in advance** to prove my base was there—not in Libya—and to show commitment and stability. I brought contracts, itineraries, bank statements. None of it seemed to matter. I left the consulate with a familiar feeling: confusion, frustration, and the sense that my case hadn’t been taken seriously.

I don’t control borders. I control what I do next.

## Where the switch flipped

As a kid, I loved games—more than I loved Marvel movies. My favorite? Spider-Man! The scenes of NY Times Square are etched in my brain. That is a place I want to be. I loved video games a lot, but I knew if I wanted to be in the US, I had to be serious. I stopped playing and poured those hours into studying. Reps, not hacks. I learned that if I keep showing up every day, even in small ways, momentum compounds. That discipline, more than any single break, has carried me.

## Ambition is a checkpoint, not a destination

I used to think success was a single win: a big-name job, a visa stamp, an acceptance email. Over time I stopped treating ambition like a finish line and started treating it like **checkpoints**. Nail the next rep. Learn the next concept. Ship the next feature. Repeat.

I joined [Manara](https://manara.tech/) to sharpen my fundamentals and interview skills. Had my first interview at Google Poland office in 2021. I failed the interview due to skill issues. That stung.

## The work that matters

I’m proud of the work I contributed to [OCP](https://github.com/open-captable-protocol/ocp): changing how equity is managed so more founders it's the tech that was eventually used at [Fairmint](https://fairmint.com/), that mission was real: make equity easier to issue, manage, and use. My job was simple: **ship**.

I measure myself by output:

- Did we reduce manual steps and human errors?
- Did we collapse customer bug to production-fix time?
- Did users gain clarity instead of confusion?

That’s the scoreboard I trust and hold myself accountable.

## Building where doors are actually open

Along the way, I helped port the Open Cap Table Protocol ([OCP](https://github.com/open-captable-protocol/ocp)) to Solana. That work drew interest from the Solana Foundation. More importantly, it reminded me of a truth I keep coming back to: **code is permissionless**. You can reject my US visa. You can freeze my Deel account. You can’t stop me from writing software that works.

When one platform or policy closes a door, I look for the rooms where merit still speaks the loudest *open source*.

That’s where I invest attention.

## When labels try to lead the story

I’ve lost opportunities because of a passport—opportunities I worked hard to earn. Compliance reviews. Payment platforms. Vague emails with “internal policy” in the subject line. In those moments, it’s easy to spiral: **why me, why this, why now**?

I give myself a short window to feel it. Then I ask two questions:

1. What can I **control**?
2. What can I **build** that no one can ignore?
3. How can I be in **service** to people?

Usually the answers look like this:

- Improve docs and tests so my work is easier to adopt.
- Publish a demo that speaks for itself.
- Unblock a friend or teammate.
- Simplify & reduce complexity.

Not dramatic. Just deliberate.

## The setback I won’t let define me

My passport will likely be a friction point for a while. I’ve had payments reversed and contracts ended for reasons that had nothing to do with performance. I was frustrated. And I’m still **grateful**—because I have a skill that lets me contribute without asking for permission first.

If one door closes, I don’t camp outside. I map the next route.

## Agency over narrative

I can’t control policies, but I can control my **attention**. I can decide what I practice, what I publish, and whom I help. That’s not motivational fluff; it’s operational. Attention is the most valuable thing I own, and I invest it where it compounds: learning, shipping, teaching.

Here’s how that looks day to day:

- **Reps:** short, focused work blocks that move the needle forward.
- **Proof:** code, tests, and changelogs—things others can run, not just read.
- **Service:** help a founder or friend remove uncertainty or solve problems in their tech. Pay it forward.

## I represent myself

I’m not a flag. I’m not a statistic. I represent myself and the work I stand behind. I care about inovation. I care about building tech that outlast me. And I care about being useful to people who are trying to build something honest.

## The choice I make very time

I choose the narrative. I control my life. Not my passport. Not a government. Me.

The work continues tomorrow. Same reps. Clearer focus. Better service.

### Three takeaways I hope you leave with

1. **Agency over labels.** You can’t pick your passport, but you can pick your response—habits, output, integrity.
2. **Progress through adaptation.** When a door shuts, stop arguing with the door. Design a path around it.
3. **Value beyond status.** The scoreboard is the outcomes you create, not the logos you collect.
