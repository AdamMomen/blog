Humans talk in feelings.

Computers talk in protocols.

This post explores what happens when we learn from the latter, when we start communicating with precision, acknowledgment, and zero ambiguity.
When we *talk like HTTP.*


### When Uncertainty Feels Heavy

You send someone a message.
Three days pass. No reply.

You see the gray “delivered” tick — but not the blue “seen.”
And suddenly, your mind starts writing its own stories.

Maybe they’re not interested.
Maybe they saw it but don’t know what to say.
Maybe they haven’t even opened it yet.

That uncertainty — the weight of *not knowing* — is exhausting.
It’s the emotional equivalent of a packet stuck in transit.


### The Old World Had No Receipts

Back in the days of physical letters, you’d send mail and simply *hope* it reached the other person.
There were no delivery receipts. No “typing…” indicators. No “last seen.”

You sent. You waited.
That was it.

Today, we have all this technology meant to reduce uncertainty — yet emotionally, communication feels *more uncertain* than ever.


### The Three Possibilities

When someone doesn’t reply, it usually falls into one of three buckets:

a) The receiver is **not interested**.
b) The receiver **needs more time** to reply.
c) The receiver **hasn’t read** the message yet.

But here’s the problem: we rarely clarify *which one it is*.
And that lack of clarity fuels endless interpretation.


### Politeness Isn’t Always Kindness

My parents taught me to be polite — and that’s good.
But I’ve realized politeness often hides discomfort.

Sometimes, giving a clear, uncomfortable answer (“I’m not interested”)
is *kinder* than leaving someone to guess.

Even a short, honest response respects the time and energy the other person spent to reach out.
“Ghosting” doesn’t protect feelings — it wastes bandwidth.

### Whose Responsibility Is It?

There are two sides to every message:
- The **sender**, who must make communication clear and meaningful.
- The **receiver**, who must acknowledge and respond intentionally.

This article focuses on the latter — the art of receiving.


### Talk Like HTTP

Let’s borrow from the internet for a moment.
HTTP — *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* — is what allows computers to communicate with each other.

Computers are brutally literal.
They can’t “guess” what the other meant.
So, they rely on **handshakes** — predefined, precise acknowledgements that eliminate ambiguity.

When one device sends a message, the other must respond in a structured sequence:
